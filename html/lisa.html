		<h3>Blackpink’s Lisa Makes Record-Breaking Solo Debut With Single, ‘Lalisa’</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>If you don't know Lisa's name already, you'll remember it now.

			The member of superstar K-pop group Blackpink is spelling it out -- literally -- on her just-released debut solo project, Lalisa, which gets its title from her full first name. And like bandmates Jennie, Jisoo and Rosé, who all pursue solo endeavors in addition to their work as a group, Lisa's bringing fans into her own world with a pair of songs that take her love of hip-hop to the next level. The title track expands on the maximalist, globe-trotting sound of Blackpink bangers like "How You Like That" with rapid-fire flows and nods to her Thai heritage -- while b-side "Money," built around a languid horn loop, is the closest she's ever gotten to contemporary American rap music, with enough hooks and dancefloor commands to inspire a TikTok craze.<br/><br/>

			The songs of Lalisa come from a familiar crew of songwriters and producers, including Teddy Park (the group’s longtime producer and creative director), Bekuh Boom (responsible for some of Lisa’s best-known rap verses), R. Tee, 24 and Vince (all of whom have credits on Blackpink’s debut album, 2020’s aptly titled The Album). But the music is only part of the experience: The "Lalisa" video is also another elaborate showcase for the dancing skills that have wowed audiences (see: her nightly dance medleys from Blackpink’s last world tour) and inspired viral Twitter memes.<br/><br/>

			Lisa has described her ability to quickly pick up complex choreography as a kind of superpower. But for an artist who grew up in Thailand, trained for pop stardom in South Korea and now performs for fans from all over, she says pairing the music with the visuals is just the best way to express herself and tell her story.<br/><br/>

			"People might not understand what the lyrics are, but listening to the beat and seeing the dance, they can feel the vibe and have that connection," a hoodie-clad Lisa says over Zoom one evening from a Seoul recording studio. (She does the interview mostly in English, with occasional asides in Korean and Thai to a pair of translators sitting just outside of frame.) It’s a few days before the project’s release, and Lisa is animated, quick with one-liners and happy to laugh at herself -- but mostly just excited to share another side with the fans who have stuck with the group for five years. Says Lisa: “It's a good opportunity for me to finally let the world know, ‘This is who I am.’”<br/><br/>

			Below, she tells Billboard about stepping up her rap skills, unlocking a new level of confidence and what goes into her eye-popping dance routines.</p>
